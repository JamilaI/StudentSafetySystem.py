# StudentSafetySystem.py
Keep students safe during their education journey by using our prototype

**Description:**

The Student Safety System is a Python-based application designed as a prototype to enhance the safety and security of students by providing various emergency alerts and safety features. 
It utilizes the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface and the Pillow (PIL) library for image handling. 
This system allows users to receive and respond to different alerts, such as emergency alerts, student attendance alerts, COVID-19 alerts, student escape alerts, and electricity detection.

**Usage:**

Upon running the application, you'll be presented with the Student Safety System interface.

Click on the "Emergency Alert" button to access the Emergency Alert System. This system allows you to:

Simulate emergency scenarios (e.g., fire, tornado, earthquake).
Notify authorities.
View a history of emergency alerts.
Select the type of alert you want to simulate.
Additional buttons on the main interface provide functionality for other safety alerts and features, such as student attendance alerts, COVID-19 alerts, student escape alerts, and electricity detection.

If an emergency alert is triggered, a pop-up message will notify you, and you should take necessary precautions as per the alert type.

Stay updated with the latest alerts and safety features through this Student Safety System

**Installation**:
To run the Student Safety System, follow these installation steps:

Ensure you have Python installed. This application was developed in Python 3.9 on Pycharm.
Install the required Python packages by running the following command:

pip install Pillow prettytable
pip install tkinter

Download the project files, including any necessary images and icons.

Run the Python script (student_safety_system.py) to start the application.


**Features:**
Emergency Alert System with various alert types (fire, tornado, earthquake, security, flood, medical).
Simulate emergency scenarios for training purposes.
Notify authorities in case of an emergency.
View a history of emergency alerts.
Safety features for student attendance, COVID-19, student escape, and electricity detection.
User-friendly graphical interface.

Future Work:
While the Student Safety System is functional and provides valuable safety features, there is always room for enhancement and expansion.
